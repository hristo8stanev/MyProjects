## Overview

Welcome to the WEAre Social Network project repository, created as part of our final project at Telerik Academy. This repository provides comprehensive details and reports on the testing of the WEAre Social Network project. Our social network is designed to connect individuals who can mutually benefit by exchanging skills and services. Users can create posts, leave comments, and show appreciation through likes.

## Testing Strategy

We have adopted the Agile Scrumban methodology, organizing our work into sprints. For more information about our testing approach and strategies, please visit our [01WEareTestPlan folder](https://github.com/FINAL-PROJECT-T-H-K/Social-Network-Project/tree/main/01WEareTestPlan).
